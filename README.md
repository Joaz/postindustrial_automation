postindustrial_automation
=========================

This project aims to be a toolbox to help you to automatise tasks of any kind, preferably at low hardware cost.

Why?
========================= 
People are using software tools to automate their jobs at daily basis. But most of them can't automate phyiscal things yet.
Now with the low-cost 3D-Printing technology one can now make tools that have never existed before at very little cost.


Requirements
=========================
For most of the files, the minimum you'll need is a low cost 3D printer like a Reprap and some other basic tools.

The files are made in OpenSCAD, get at: 
http://www.openscad.org/


How to get started
==========================
Make sure to fetch the submodules:

# git submodule init && git submodule update

Have a look at the .scad files and generate STLs to load into a 3D Printer. We'll make STLs for all working models.
