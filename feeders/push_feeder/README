Simple feeder by pushing/pulling things.

Status: Prototype working.

Estimated costs:

- rod 0.20 EUR
- microswitches: 0.20 EUR
- motor: ~ 3 EUR in bulk (low estimate)
- hardware: 0.10 EUR
- printed parts (approx 100g): ~ 1.7 EUR

Total: ~ 5.20 EUR


This design is suitable for things that can be stacked in a row and can be pushed easily.
It's capacity is limited by the lenght of the tube.

Print out a tube, motor holder and a puller, and assemble.
You need an M5 rod, M5 nut and some self tapping screws (about 2,9x13)

Put a small object below the exit of the tube to have it mounted in a small angle.

Bugs:
- the motor currently used is far too big for the application. needs a small motor and a smaller mount to get everything falling down.
- there needs to be a min endstop, as well as a max endstop since you want it to wind back when filling.
- there is no active feedback on this thing. you need to weight the output. 
- greasy things may not fall individually. Maybe need to cross-breed this with a wheel similar to the bearing feeder.


Pros: 
- cheap
- easy to replicate
- pretty small footprint 

Cons:
- small capacity
- no feedback
- problems with greasy things
