Washer feeding
--------------------

For this project, I used a hopper that ejects coins and is usually used in a slot machine. It is called a "cube hopper mk2".
The default payout disk (type 99) would work out of the box for feeding large M8 washers. 

The custom payout disk that is printed should be able to feed normal washers.
