Washer feeding
--------------------

For this project, I used a hopper that ejects coins and is usually used in a slot machine. It is called a "cube hopper mk2".
The default payout disk (type 99) would work out of the box for feeding large M8 washers. 

The custom payout disk that is printed should be able to feed normal washers.


Notes:
1. The internal electronics in this hopper isn't made for continuous operation. 
   As the TIP120 gets warm, the motor gets slower and finally stalls. The device can shoot out about 60-70 washers until it stops.
   After it cooled a bit, it can resume operation normally.
2. Putting 24V directly on the motor will cause a printed hopped disk to break at the motor mount. Seems like the motor should be run at about 18V.
